# Google Calendar Application for HackBU 2020
I found adding individual classes tedious and time consuming, so I have made an application to make it a little simpler and more automated. It has a few instructions:
# Semester Start/End:
Input the start date and end date of the semester
# Number of Classes:
Input the amount of classes you have for the semester. Changing this amount resets the schedule, so be careful.
# Class #:
Select the class you wish to edit.
# Name and Location:
Pretty self-explanatory, input the name and location of the class (Ex. for PHYS 131 in Science Library 313, the name would be PHYS 131 and the location is Science Library 313.
# Color:
Select the color of the event in the calendar.
# Start/End Time:
Input the start and end time of the class.
# Day Checkboxes:
Check off the days of the week you have the class. Once you do this, the chart to the right will show a preview of the schedule.
# Add Semester Button:
Once all of the classes have been inputted, click this button. It will call the Google Calendar API and add all of the events you wrote.
